1. Implement redux with net ninja.
  - add map dispatch to props ✅
  Notes:
  learned how to change state on front end. Only works due to routing, once we refresh, all del posts come back.
  need to learn how to adapt to API requests.
  (send delete request, get new posts etc.)
  it is ok to change on FE as long as we make a delete request actually delete it from the BE,
  and then an APIreq fired in component did mount, which loads all posts at the main route.
